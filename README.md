# Crystalball

Crystalball is a Ruby library which implements [Regression Test Selection mechanism](https://tenderlovemaking.com/2015/02/13/predicting-test-failues.html) originally published by Aaron Patterson.
Its main purpose is to select a minimal subset of your test suite which should be run to ensure your changes didn't break anything.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
group :test do
  gem 'crystalball'
end
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install crystalball

## Usage

Please see our [official documentation](https://toptal.github.io/crystalball/).

### Predictor Mode: 

Predictor mode gives you the ability to run Crystalball in a way that it will predict which tests will run and output the mapping in a configurable file location.

To use Crystalball in predictor mode, add the following command before bundle exec:

```ruby
CRYSTALBALL_PREDICTOR_RUNNER=true
```

Default location of output file is `tmp/predicted_specs.txt` 

To change this value set `CRYSTALBALL_PREDICTED_SPECS_FILE_PATH`

### Versioning

We use [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/) for our [releases](https://github.com/toptal/crystalball/releases).
